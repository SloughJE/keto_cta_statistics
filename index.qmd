# Univariable Linear Models
At best: exploratory. 

At worst: misleading.

## 1 Univariable Linear Models {.smaller}

> "Linear models on the primary (NCPV) and secondary outcomes were **univariable**"

::: {.fragment}

Despite having multiple predictors available (age, sex, ApoB, BMI, Triglycerides, Systolic blood pressure, CAC, NCPV₀, LDL-C exposure),  
each was tested separately in single-predictor regressions.

:::

::: {.fragment}

This modeling choice introduces **omitted-variable bias**:  

"...omitting a relevant variable from a model which explains the independent and dependent variable leads to biased estimates." - [Wilms (2021)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354514325_Omitted_variable_bias_A_threat_to_estimating_causal_relationships)

:::

::: {.fragment}

<br>
A predictor may appear significant in a univariable model, but its effect can vanish once relevant covariates are included

This is very common, especially in observational studies, with small datasets and highly correlated predictors.

:::

## 1 Univariable Linear Models {.smaller}

#### Example: ΔNCPV, ApoB and Age 

They modeled:

$$
\Delta \text{NCPV} = \alpha + \beta \text{ApoB} + \varepsilon
$$

::: {.fragment}

But if **age** also predicts ΔNCPV and correlates with ApoB, then $\beta$ is **biased** and partly reflects the effect of age.


A more appropriate model would be:

$$
\Delta \text{NCPV} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{ApoB} + \beta_2 \text{Age} + \varepsilon
$$

:::

::: {.fragment}

This separates the contribution of ApoB from that of age.

:::
::: {.fragment}

<br>
Univariable linear models make omitted-variable bias and likely confounding almost certain, especially in small non-randomized human data. This undermines any claim of association or non-association.

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate. Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model."

::: {.fragment}

Additionally, Table 3 includes one multivariable regression on the primary outcome $\Delta \text{NCPV}$:

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 0.85; padding-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>$\Delta \text{NCPV} = \alpha + \beta_1 \, \text{CAC}_{\text{bl}} + \beta_2 \, \Delta \text{ApoB} + \beta_3 \, (\text{CAC}_{\text{bl}} \times \Delta \text{ApoB}) + \varepsilon$</li>
  <li>Appears to be the only **adjusted model** involving $\Delta \text{NCPV}$</li>
</ul>

But the paper provides absolutely no explanation or rationale for this model. 

:::

</div>

<br>
<div style="font-size: 85%; margin-top: 1em;">

::: {.fragment}

So they did use three **multivariable models**.
One on the main outcome $\Delta \text{NCPV}$ and two in their Age Mediation Analysis on NCPV at follow-up.

:::

::: {.fragment}

They never modeled $\Delta \text{NCPV}$ with a full set of available covariates.

:::

::: {.fragment}

<br>
This selective use raises questions.

# ΔNCPV as Outcome Variable
**Plaque begets plaque**: biology or mathematical artifact?


## 2 ΔNCPV as Outcome Variable {.smaller}


> "All baseline plaque metrics (coronary artery calcium, NCPV, total plaque score, and percent atheroma volume) were strongly associated with the **change in NCPV**."

::: {.fragment}


Change in noncalcified plaque volume $\Delta \text{NCPV}$ was the outcome:

$$
\Delta \text{NCPV} = \text{NCPV}_{1} - \text{NCPV}_0
$$

They regressed $\Delta \text{NCPV}$ directly on its baseline value $\text{NCPV}_0$:  

$$
\Delta \text{NCPV} = \alpha + \beta \, \text{NCPV}_0 + \varepsilon
$$

:::
::: {.fragment}

But this introduces **mathematical coupling**, because $\text{NCPV}_0$ appears on both sides of the equation:

$$
\text{NCPV}_{1} - \text{NCPV}_0 = \alpha + \beta \, \text{NCPV}_0 + \varepsilon
$$

["Mathematical coupling occurs when one variable directly or indirectly contains the whole or part of another, and the two variables are then analysed using correlation or regression. As a result, the statistical procedure of testing the null hypothesis — that the coefficient of correlation or the slope of regression is zero — might no longer be appropriate."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16526009/) - Tu & Gilthorpe, 2007

Regression model: $\text{NCPV}_{1} - \text{NCPV}_0 = \alpha + \beta \, \text{NCPV}_0 + \varepsilon$

<br>
The regression coefficient (slope): $\beta  = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(\Delta \text{NCPV},\ \text{NCPV}_0)}{\operatorname{Var}(\text{NCPV}_0)} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}((\text{NCPV}_1 - \text{NCPV}_0),\ \text{NCPV}_0)}{\operatorname{Var}(\text{NCPV}_0)}$

<br>
This simplifies to: $\beta = \frac{\rho\, \sigma_1 - \sigma_0}{\sigma_0}$  

where:

- $\rho = \operatorname{Cor}(\text{NCPV}_0,\ \text{NCPV}_1)$  
- $\sigma_0$, $\sigma_1$ = SDs at baseline and follow-up

<div style="font-size: 85%; ">

From Oldham* (1962): $\beta > 0 \quad\text{if}\quad \rho > \frac{\sigma_0}{\sigma_1}$

The slope depends on:

- **correlation** between baseline and follow-up ($\rho$)
- **relative spread** of the two time points

::: {.fragment}

A negative slope can arise entirely from mathematical coupling, while a positive slope in this model always includes some mathematical artifact but may also reflect a genuine biological association.

In this study:

- Almost all participants had increased NCPV
- Implies $\rho$ was moderate-to-high, and $\sigma_1 > \sigma_0$

These conditions tend to bias the slope upward. 

:::

::: {.fragment}

The slope reflects a mix of true correlation ($\rho$), variability ratio ($\sigma_1/\sigma_0$), and structural bias from subtracting $NCPV_0$ from both sides.

## 2 ΔNCPV as Outcome Variable {.smaller}


An alternative is to model NCPV at follow-up ($\text{NCPV}_1$) directly while adjusting for baseline NCPV. This example uses ApoB as the independent variable:

$$
\text{NCPV}_1 = \alpha + \gamma\,\text{NCPV}_0 + \beta ApoB + \varepsilon
$$

This approach avoids mathematical coupling, reduces residual variance, and allows the coefficient on $ApoB$ to reflect biological association — not algebraic structure.


<br>

::: {.fragment}


You could test whether baseline NCPV predicts follow-up using a mixed-effects model with a Time × Baseline interaction:

> $$
> \text{NCPV}_{ij} = \alpha + \gamma\,\text{Time}_{ij} + \beta\,\text{NCPV}_{0j} + \delta\,(\text{Time}_{ij} \cdot \text{NCPV}_{0j}) + b_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
> $$

but the with the number of subjects this must be done carefully.

<div style="font-size: 90%; line-height: 0.8;">
You cannot determine whether a positive or negative slope from ΔNCPV ∼ NCPV₀ reflects biology or math, because the math builds the relationship.
To isolate biological effects, you must model follow-up directly with baseline as a covariate — not as part of the outcome.

# Bayesian Modeling 
Unusual. Fragile. Overstated.


## 3 Bayesian Inference {.smaller}

<div style="font-size: 75%;">

**Frequentist:**

::: {.fragment}

Assuming there is no true association between ApoB and ΔNCPV, how likely is it that we'd observe a slope as large (or larger) than the one we found, just by chance?

If p-value (p > 0.05) a frequentist analysis can say:

*"We did not find sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that ApoB has no association with ΔNCPV"*

It **cannot** say the null is likely true, or produce the probability that there is no association, just that the data were inconclusive.

:::

<br>
**Bayesian:**

::: {.fragment}

How well do the data fit under two competing models, one with no association (null), and one with a range of plausible effect sizes for ApoB (alternative)?

A **Bayes factor (e.g., BF₁₀ = 6)** allows a stronger statement:

*"The observed data are 6 times more likely (moderate evidence) under the 'no association' model than under the alternative model that assumes some effect from ApoB (as defined by the prior)."*

:::

::: {.fragment}

- **Frequentist**: *"No evidence of effect"*  
- **Bayesian**: *"Evidence for no effect"*

</div>

## 3 Bayesian Inference {.smaller}

> "Since lack of statistical significance (ie, P > 0.05) should not be interpreted as evidence in favor of the null but simply a failure to reject the null, the addition of Bayesian inference adds credence to finding that there is no association between NCPV vs LDL-C or ApoB..."

## 4 Bayesian Prior Choice {.smaller}


<div style="font-size: 73%;">

> "Bayes factors were calculated using BayesFactor::regressionBF... and an ~ rscale value of 0.8 to *contrast a moderately informative prior with a conservative distribution width* (to allow for potential large effect sizes) due to the well-documented association between ApoB changes and coronary plaque changes"

</div>


<div style="font-size: 90%;">

::: {.fragment}

<br>
**Bayesian Prior**: represents your belief about likely effect sizes before seeing the data.

From the [BayesFactor documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesFactor/BayesFactor.pdf) for the parameter `rscaleCont`:

"Several named values are recognized: [‘medium’, ‘wide’, and ‘ultrawide’](https://richarddmorey.github.io/BayesFactor/#proptest), which correspond to rscales of √2/4, 1/2, and √2/2, respectively.”

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 0.9; font-size: 80%; padding-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>**"medium"** → rscale = √2 / 4 ≈ **0.354**</li>
  <li>**"wide"** → rscale = **0.5**</li>
  <li>**"ultrawide"** → rscale = √2 / 2 ≈ **0.707**</li>
</ul>

:::

::: {.fragment}

`rscale` of **0.8** is **wider than "ultrawide"**. It is not a "moderately informative" prior. It's actually a weakly informative or vague prior, placing most of its weight on large effects.

A moderately informative prior would typically correspond to "medium" (≈ 0.354) or "wide" (0.5), which place more mass on smaller effects.

:::

</div>

---

## 4 Bayesian Prior Choice {.smaller}

The authors' prior choice isn't wrong, but their description of it is misleading.

Labeling an **r = 0.8** prior as “moderately informative” or “conservative” downplays the fact that it assumes **large effects**, making small observed effects look unlikely under H₁ and inflating support for H₀.

<br>

::: {.fragment}

Their choice of prior is subjective, influential, and not tested for robustness.

- The model was set up to expect large ApoB effects, so small observed effects are treated as evidence for no effect. 

- **Best practice** is to run a **sensitivity analysis**, to see whether conclusions change with different priors.

# Additional Concerns

## No Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons {.smaller}

At least 14 distinct linear regressions were reported, with likely many more from exploratory models referenced in figures and supplements.

Numerous tests increase false positive risk, yet no multiple testing correction was applied.

::: {.fragment}

Such as:


* Bonferroni: α = 0.05 → α′ ≈ 0.005  
  Baseline CAC (P < 0.001) would survive; others might not  
* Benjamini–Hochberg FDR maintains power with correlated tests

:::

::: {.fragment}

Perhaps the authors viewed this as exploratory, where correction is often skipped —  
**but then why title the paper "Plaque Begets Plaque, ApoB Does Not"?**

:::

---

## Zero-inflation, censoring, heteroscedasticity {.smaller}

<div style="font-size: 80%;">
Baseline NCPV median = 44 mm³; **TPS median = 0** → ≥50% of values are zero  
CCTA cannot report negative plaque → both outcomes are **left-censored at 0**

This affects not just modeling but measurement:  
When true plaque ≈ 0, **error is asymmetric** — it can only overestimate.

::: {.fragment}

ΔNCPV, their primary outcome, is a change score between two bounded, skewed measures.  
Likely to produce **non-normal residuals** and **heteroscedasticity** (e.g., larger spread at higher baseline).

> If smaller baseline values were also linked to larger increases,  
> this may reflect the effects of left-censoring and error asymmetry — not true biological acceleration.

:::

::: {.fragment}

These issues are **clear in TPS**, and may affect NCPV, but diagnostics are not shown.

*OLS assumes homoscedastic, normal residuals*  
*performance::check_model() was run — but no output provided*

They could have considered methods to address this such as: **Tobit regression**, **log-transform**, or **robust SEs**

## Sensitivity Analysis {.smaller}

>Study abstract: "Plaque progression predictors were assessed with linear regression and Bayes factors. Diet adherence and baseline cardiovascular disease risk sensitivity analyses were performed."<br>

<div style="font-size: 85%;">

The authors conducted an apparent **post hoc** "sensitivity analyses" in two subgroups:

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 0.9; font-size: 80%; padding-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>**High adherence** ($n = 56$): >80% of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate values ≥ 0.3 mmol/L</li>
  <li>**High CVD risk** ($n = 28$): MESA 10-year risk >5%</li>
</ul>

:::

The subgroups may partially overlap — the paper doesn’t say.  
Without clarity, it's unclear if results reflect **replication** or **redundancy**.

The same individuals may be contributing to both sets of sensitivity analyses.

This limits interpretability and weakens claims of consistency across groups.

## On the Heterogeneity of LMHR {.smaller}

> ["If, despite our results show that CVD risk among LMHRs is heterogeneous (and thus, **a pooled summary isn't a good idea**), you must have a numerical pooled NCPVchange value, it is: p50=18.8 mm3 IQR(37.3)."](https://x.com/AdrianSotoMota/status/1910045858152042999) - X post from Author

::: {.fragment}

<br>
The group is heterogeneous (to downplay the pooled NCPV change), yet they ran univariable regressions and interpreted Bayes factors on that group.

:::
::: {.fragment}

<br> 
If a group is too heterogeneous to report pooled outcomes, it is also too heterogeneous for pooled inferences about predictors or mechanisms.

If their CVD risk (e.g., plaque progression) is not coherent, then the category fails as a predictive or explanatory label.

:::

All clinical populations are heterogeneous in risk.

## On the Heterogeneity of LMHR {.smaller}

<div style="font-size: 85%">


> "p50=18.8 mm3 IQR(37.3)."

With a median of 18.8 mm³ and only 1–2 individuals showing regression, the IQR of 37.3 mm³ must be mostly skewed upward, not balanced.

A wide IQR here reflects high inter-individual variability in outcomes among the LMHRs, variability in progression of NCPV, as all but a few individuals had more plaque at follow up.

::: {.fragment}

In other words: With nearly all LMHRs showing plaque progression, a wide IQR (37.3 mm³) doesn’t indicate balanced variability—it reflects differing degrees of worsening.

:::
::: {.fragment}

<br>

This matters because:

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; line-height: 1; padding-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>The outcome (ΔNCPV) shows high variability across individuals in the LMHR group.</li>
  <li>That inflates standard errors, weakens statistical power, and makes small observed effects more ambiguous.</li>
  <li>It calls for adjusted modeling to reduce noise and account for confounding, not pooled univariable regressions and Bayes factors interpreted as strong evidence.</li>

From the response:

>"Regarding the analytical points brought forward, we are aware of the relevance of linear assumptions to obtain accurate estimators. Since **residual plot evaluation** can also be **subjective**..."

:::

::: {.fragment}

Objective, quantitative statistical tests also exist for assessing model assumptions:

<ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1; padding-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>Normality: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Q-Q plots (visual / quantitative)</li>
  <li>Homoscedasticity: Breusch–Pagan, White test</li>
  <li>Influence / leverage: Cook's distance, leverage plots (visual based on quantitative values)</li>

The `performance::check_model()` function they cite automatically generates most of these checks.

>"Along the same lines, we would like to clarify that our title was not meant to be a statement about causality. “Plaque begets plaque” (which, of course, mirrors the proverb “Money begets money”) is frequently used to highlight the strong and clinically relevant association of baseline plaque values with plaque progression rate [[7]](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2241011191?journalCode=radiology). 

::: {.fragment}

That journal citation [[7]](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2241011191?journalCode=radiology) used a random-effects repeated-measures model, a type of longitudinal multivariable regression that accounts for the non-independence of repeated observations within individuals, and controlled for baseline calcium score and traditional risk factors. 

This approach was chosen after detecting heteroskedasticity in a preliminary multivariable linear regression. Both models were multivariable (adjusted), not univariable.
